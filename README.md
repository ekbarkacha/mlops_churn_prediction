# Project: Real-Time Customer Churn Prediction System

## Overview

Customer churn is the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company which poses a significant challenge to the telecommunications industry. High churn rates can lead to substantial revenue losses, reduced market share and hindered long-term growth. Therefore, accurately identifying customers who are likely to churn and intervening before they leave is critical for maintaining business stability and profitability.

This project focuses on building a Real-Time Customer Churn Prediction System powered by Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). The solution will continuously analyze customer data to predict churn probability and suggest what lead to it in real time. By integrating automated data pipelines, model retraining workflows, CI/CD orchestration, and inference APIs, the system ensures that predictions remain accurate, reliable and actionable.
